### CMD-Desktop
This was a fun little project that i was working on in my free time

the point of the project was to push curses to its limit and see if i could make an entire windowing system, text editor, web browser
making a full fledged desktop system with apps entirely in your terminal


### Current State
In its current state you can create move and snap windows entirely in your terminal
There is also icons that work like normal shortcuts when you double click it, opens a new window of that icons type 


### Biggest Roadblock
I primarily stopped deveolpment on this project due to an annoying bug 

When you click and drag a window around it likes to lag behind on the inputs and for either indefintly or for 10-30 seconds will think you are still clicking and things will snap around I think this has less to do with my programming abilites and more the limited funcionatiliy that curses has to interact with the mouse reliably in the way i want
