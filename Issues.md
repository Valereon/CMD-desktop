### Issues
- the entire windows flickers when its too large such as fullscreen (I dont know if this is a me issues or a curses itself issue)
- it seems *sometimes* the icons on the desktop takes Z-priotiy over the windows
- the resizing of the window is weirdly offset at differnent window sizes
- for whatever reason when resizing, when you resize to a larger size and try to resize again it offsets back to the orignal size




not *really an issue* but when you move things you move them from the top left corner always instead of where you clicked so you click in the middle of a window to move it and it snaps to the topleft to move so fix that
